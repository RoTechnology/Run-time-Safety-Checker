# Run-time-Safety-Checker

The RSC (Run-Time Safety Checker) is a software module proposed to be used for control and management of the parameters that could be critical for the flight of the drone. The implementation is based on the predefined Safety Rules which define the functioning of the component. The module will be activated whenever one of the safety rules fails and thus it will implement a resolution procedure. The module requires the management of several parameters and their combination as the conditions that may occur are various. 

The RSC tool actually is built for a specific Comp4Drones Runtime Safety, Alarms Systems case study.
